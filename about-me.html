    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting my site. I’m a BFA Design student at Queens college and graduated with an AS in Fine Arts from LaGuardia CC in 2010.  Throughout the years I’ve gained experience in many different fields that have given me many valuable skills that I use in my professional life as well as my personal life. I hope to continue learning and experiencing art all around the world. </p>
